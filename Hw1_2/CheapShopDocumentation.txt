# Cheap Shop Catalog System Portfolio

## Project Overview
A modern web-based implementation of a catalog shopping system, designed to replace paper-based ordering systems in retail environments.

## Technical Implementation
- React/Next.js for component architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- CSS Modules for styling
- State management using React hooks

## Key Features
1. Two-stage order entry process
2. Real-time total calculation
3. Form validation
4. Order confirmation system

## User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single Item Purchase
1. Customer finds item in catalog (e.g., Lamp #A123)
2. Clerk enters customer details
3. Enters item #A123, quantity 1, price $50
4. Clicks "Trigger Invoice"
5. Total: $50
6. Order processed

### Scenario 2: Multiple Item Purchase
1. Customer selects multiple items:
   - Chair #B456 ($100)
   - Table #C789 ($200)
2. Clerk enters customer details
3. Enters first item
4. Clicks "Next Catalog Item"
5. Enters second item
6. Clicks "Trigger Invoice"
7. Total: $300
8. Order processed

## Design Decisions
1. Two-dialog approach matches existing workflow
2. Confirmation dialogs prevent errors
3. Real-time calculations improve accuracy
4. Form validation ensures data quality

## Future Enhancements
1. Barcode scanner integration
2. Inventory management
3. Customer history tracking
4. Digital catalog integration
