        <h2>1. Application Description</h2>
        <p>
            This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game as a single HTML page web application with JavaScript. 
            The Snake game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that moves around a grid, eating food to grow longer 
            while avoiding collisions with walls and itself. This implementation features modern design, responsive controls, and 
            additional gameplay features to enhance the user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game offers two difficulty levels:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Easy:</strong> Moderate speed with 2 points awarded per food item</li>
            <li><strong>Hard:</strong> Faster speed with obstacles, 3 points per food item, and increasing challenge as obstacles appear when food is consumed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The game is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and accessible for users of various skill levels and devices. Special 
            attention has been paid to applying HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) principles to create an engaging and user-friendly experience.
        </p>

    <section id="design-implementation">
        <h2>2. Design and Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            The Snake game was designed with a focus on simplicity and responsiveness. The key design decisions and implementation approaches are:
        </p>
        
        <h3>Design Approach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Canvas-based rendering:</strong> The game uses HTML5 Canvas for smooth graphics rendering</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive design:</strong> Adapts to different screen sizes with CSS media queries</li>
            <li><strong>Minimalist UI:</strong> Clean, distraction-free interface with important information clearly visible</li>
            <li><strong>Color psychology:</strong> Used green for the snake (representing growth), red for food (representing rewards), and purple for obstacles (representing danger)</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback mechanisms:</strong> Clear visual and interactive feedback for user actions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game loop:</strong> Uses <code>setTimeout</code> for game tick control with variable speeds based on difficulty</li>
            <li><strong>State management:</strong> Tracks game state (running, paused, game over) with appropriate UI updates</li>
            <li><strong>Collision detection:</strong> Checks for collisions with walls, snake body, and obstacles</li>
            <li><strong>Touch controls:</strong> Implemented swipe gestures for mobile users</li>
            <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Persists high score between sessions using browser's localStorage API</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic obstacle generation:</strong> Intelligent placement algorithm for obstacles in hard mode</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Libraries and Tools Used</h2>
        <p>
            The Snake game was developed as a standalone web application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without external libraries. 
            This approach keeps the application lightweight and dependency-free.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The Snake game demonstrates the application of HCI principles to create an engaging, accessible, and user-friendly 
            web application. By focusing on intuitive controls, clear feedback, error prevention, and responsive design, the game 
            provides an enjoyable experience for users across different devices and skill levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key achievements of this project include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing classic Snake gameplay with modern features and enhancements</li>
            <li>Creating a fully responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices</li>
            <li>Applying HCI principles systematically to improve user experience</li>
            <li>Balancing challenge and accessibility through difficulty options</li>
            <li>Developing the entire game as a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript and no external dependencies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This project demonstrates how even a simple game can be enhanced through careful attention to HCI principles, 
            resulting in a more engaging and accessible experience for users.
